  <p>The United States and North Korea are prepared to "generate results" in their upcoming working-level nuclear disarmament talks with
  both sides pursuing a more flexible approach in a possible lead-up to another summit between the two countries' leaders,
  Foreign Minister Kang Kyung-wha said Wednesday.</p>

  "We cannot jump to conclusions, but as far as I know, both sides are fully prepared to
  achieve results in the upcoming negotiations," Kang told lawmakers during a National Assembly annual audit of her ministry.
